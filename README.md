# Aquapocalypse

Tuesday:
Learn phaser and develop the game

Create seeds
Remove Player and  from db, and add Scores


I am a fish
The enemies are ais
There may be other player fish

Fish all have a point value
Larger fish eats smaller fish and gains its points

Start with single player, and add mp if time (could be a future development)

What to research in phaser?
Large playing space
fish food stuff
obstacles/safe havens
layers?
ground -> fish layer -> hidey holes e.g. lily pads
stick items to the camera

Other phaser tutorials
